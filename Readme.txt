Part I 
Git Account  
Git is our repository manager tool. If you don’t already have Git, installing it isn’t difficult. See the Git
website at https://git-scm.com and follow the instructions there to download and install on your
Platform and you can create a Git account at https://github.com. This is an important task as you
need to share your Git repo for your weekly tasks through the OnTrack. 
 
 
Part II 
Serving a simple HTML by creating a web server with Node.js  
To build a Website in Node.js we will use Express framework. Any other framework can also be used
but Express is very popular when using Node. Following the instruction steps in your practical
session, make sure to create your own simple web page.
